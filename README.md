This is the UI for the Electronic Monitoring project application.
- Currently in Discovery/Alpha phase
- Based off [hmpps-template-typescript](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-typescript) - please see that project for original and setup instructions
- Linked API project: [hmpps-electronic-monitoring-data-platform-api](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-electronic-monitoring-data-platform-api)

## Before you commit
Our source control policy is to work via trunk-based development and pair programming, with frequent commits to main.

Aim to commit in small, regular chunks - a `red` --> `green` --> `refactor` cycle is a good increment.

If you are **not** pair programming, it's recommended to commit to a short-lived branch and merge in by PR.
- All linting must pass
- All code must have tests
- All tests must pass


## Running & deploying the app
### Pre requisites
- install homebrew
- run brew install jq

### Running the app
The easiest way to run the app is to use docker compose to create the service and all dependencies. 

`docker-compose pull`

`docker-compose up`


### Running the app for development

To start the main services: 

`docker-compose up --scale=app=0`

Install dependencies using `npm install`, ensuring you are using `node v18.x` and `npm v9.x`

Note: Using `nvm` (or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)), run `nvm install --latest-npm` within the repository folder to use the correct version of node, and the latest version of npm. This matches the `engines` config in `package.json` and the CircleCI build config.

And then, to build the assets and start the app with nodemon:

`npm run start:dev`

### Run linter

`npm run lint`

### Run tests

`npm run test`

### Running integration tests

For local running, start a test db, redis, and wiremock instance by:

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up`

Then run the server in test mode by:

`npm run start-feature` (or `npm run start-feature:dev` to run with nodemon)

And then either, run tests in headless mode with:

`npm run int-test`
 
Or run tests with the cypress UI:

`npm run int-test-ui`

## Resources
### Cloud resources
Resources for this app are defined in two other MoJ repositories:
- The HMPPS Cloud Platform namespace folders for this project([dev](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/hmpps-electronic-monitoring-dev), [preprod](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/hmpps-electronic-monitoring-preprod), & [prod](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/hmpps-electronic-monitoring-prod))
- [DPS Project Bootstrap /`projects.json`.](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/dps-project-bootstrap/blob/main/projects.json)
### Local resource dependencies
Locally this API runs using Docker containers. These resources are defined (for local deployment only) in [`Docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-electronic-monitoring-data-platform-ui/blob/main/docker-compose.yml). The app requires: 
* hmpps-auth - for authentication
* redis - session store and token caching
- (for test running only) a wiremock container

### Environment variables and secrets
Cloud variables are defined in [`helm_deploy`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-electronic-monitoring-data-platform-ui/tree/main/helm_deploy), as well as the above Cloud Platform and DPS Bootstrap repos. Other Kubernetes secrets should be requested in the [#hmpps-auth-audit-registers](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C02S71KUBED) channel



## Authentication
Obtaining an authentication account: You need to clone [this ticket](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/browse/HAAR-1486), changing it to your own name and email, and post in [#hmpps-auth-audit-registers](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C02S71KUBED) requesting somebody to add a dev account for you.
## Dependency Checks

The template project has implemented some scheduled checks to ensure that key dependencies are kept up to date.
If these are not desired in the cloned project, remove references to `check_outdated` job from `.circleci/config.yml`
